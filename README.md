Data Source:

Technologies:
•	Postgres SQL 16
•	Excel

While performing an exploratory data analysis on our sales data from April, we have discovered a large decline in purchases from customers registered in our loyalty program.

We are interested in identifying customers that are able to be enticed back with a marketing program; we will be searching for customers that have not returned recently.

To do so, we will run an RFM Analysis to establish customer segmentation with recency being our largest focus. 

The PDF will show work built in SQL as well as explain logic within the Excel workbook. The final section, Recommendation, summarizes findings and provides insights on next steps.
